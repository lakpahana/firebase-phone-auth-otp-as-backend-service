# firebase-phone-auth-otp-as-backend-service

Firebase Phone Authentication with OTP as a Backend Service refers to the use of Firebase, a cloud-based mobile and web application development platform, for implementing phone number-based user authentication with one-time passwords (OTPs) handled on the server-side. This approach is commonly employed in mobile and web applications to securely verify users' identities by sending them a unique OTP to their registered phone numbers, which they must enter to gain access to the application.
